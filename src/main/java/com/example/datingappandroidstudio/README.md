ABOUT OUR APP:

We created a dating app which ended up being a lot harder and more complicated than expected.
Mainly, things with persistence were really hard to do and linking things up with authentication
was very problematic at times. Testing it was even worse.

The app works in every way as intended. Unfortunately we had to cut back on functionality and we do
not have the review capabilities...yet. There might still be niche errors with the way the system
loads and tries to store images just because we are going through so many methods to do that, but
it worked fine last time I tried it. In order to change your profile picture in the edit profile
section you just need to click on the pre-existing default profile icon that is there. Then you can
choose an image from your camera roll.
